# hypRecorder
I am currently running a hilarously bad, mid-End computer. Since VokoscreeNG and SSR does not natively support Wayland (OBS is barely usable), I made a small util which uses wf-recorder and MUXER to record the screen and converts to MP4 by using FFMPEG. Its only two dependencies are wf-recorder and FFMPEG (Assuming you have simple Python libraries such as datetime and tkinter.)
