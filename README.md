# hyprecorder
I am currently running a hilarously bad, mid-End computer. Since VokoscreeNG and SSR does not natively support Wayland (OBS is barely usable), I made a small util which uses wf-recorder and MUXER to record the screen and converts to MP4 by using FFMPEG. Only two dependencies are wf-recorder and FFMPEG.
